Various list sorting and graph searching algorithms. I do this for fun, so expect these algorithms to grow as I find new challenges.

Current list:
=

* [Merge Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
* [Quick Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
* [Minimum Cut (Karger)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karger%27s_algorithm)
  - Returns the minimum number of cuts in a connected graph
* Strongly Connected Components ([Tarjan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm) and [Kosaraju](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju%27s_algorithm))
  - Two similar methods (but Tarjan is slightly more efficient) for finding all the [strongly connected components](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component/) in a graph
* Implementation of stack from scratch using Python (not yet implemented)
